Time for the message popup to connect to `state`! This will allow you to show the message popup when the game changes state, such as when the game is paused or ends.

The message popup should display when the game is paused or over. Otherwise it will be invisible. _Remember we're using CSS to control the position and visibility._

Currently the popup displays all the time. You can fix this in two steps:

1. Retrieve the `isRunning` and `gameOver` properties from `state`
1. Use them to display or hide the popup by adding or removing a CSS class name to the component's parent element!

# Hide and show the MessagePopup

This is an opportunity to see where Redux is really helping you manage your application state. The MessagePopup component is can easily be displayed or hidden based on state without having to do much work or without tightly coupling it to the rest of the application. 

Use the following logic to hide and show the message popup.

- If `isRunning` and `gameOver` is `false` the message popup
should be hidden. Hide it by adding the `hidden` class to
`className`.
- If `isRunning` is `false` the message popup should be visible
and the message text should say 'Paused'.
- If `gameOver` is `true` the message popup should be visible
and the message text should say 'Game Over'.

Again, try this on your own, and then check against the solution to see how well you matched up.

```js
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
>
// Displays a message
export default function MessagePopup(props) {
  const isRunning = useSelector((state) => state.game.isRunning)
  const gameOver = useSelector((state) => state.game.gameOver)
>
  let message = ''
  let isHidden = 'hidden'
>
  if (gameOver) {
    message = 'Game Over'
    isHidden = ''
  } else if (!isRunning) {
    message = 'Paused'
    isHidden = ''
  }
>
  return (
    <div className={`message-popup ${isHidden}`}>
      <h1>{message}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

# Product So Far
