Tetris displays the next block in the upper left corner. This is a component that will display a 4 by 4 grid of square components.

With the default game state defined it's time to connect game state to components.

The goal for this chapter is to display the next block in the NextBlock component. To do this you need to get the _index_ of the next block from game state and _map_ this to an array of squares in the component.

The index of the next block is stored at `game.nextShape` on `state`. Use this to find the array that represents this shape, at the first rotation, and map it to the grid.

The empty grid will be:

`const box = shapes[0][0]`

Remember the first block is empty. The shape would be located at:

`const block = shapes[shape][0]`

The color of the square will match the index of the shape.

To get state from Redux into this Component you'll need to connect the component with React-Redux.

# Set the Default State

First thing we need to do is set our `state` properly. Remember when we set `state = {}` in `/src/reducers/game-reducer.js`? We're not going to be able to track any state or props if we're always setting it to empty!

Luckily you built that `defaultState` function in `/utils`. Time to use it!

> [action]
>
> Import the `defaultState` function into `/src/reducers/game-reducer.js`, and then update `state` in the `gameReducer` const to the following:
>
```js
...
import { defaultState } from '../utils'
>
const gameReducer = (state = defaultState(), action) => {
>
...
>
}
```

# React-Redux Hooks: useSelector

The useSelector hook give your components access to the redux store. 

> [action]
> Add the following import near the top of `/src/components/NextBlock.js`:
>
```js
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'
```

# Get a piece of state

When using `useSelector` you'll provide a callback that recieves state from Redux and returns the `piece' of state that you're interested in. 

For the NextBlock component you need the `nextShape` piece of state. This is an integer that is the index of a shape in your array of shapes. 

In our case the store looks like this: 

```JS
state = {
  game: {
    nextShape: 1,
    rotation: 1,
    grid: [..bunch of values...],
    ... more properrties ...
  }
}
```

To get `nextShape` the syntax might look like: `state.game.nextShape`

> [action]
>
> Use the `useSelector` hook to get the `nextShape` from state. 
>
```JavaScript
...
export default function NextBlock(props) {
	const nextShape = useSelector((state) => state.game.nextShape)
	...
}
```

# Display the next shape

Shapes are stored in an array of arrays of arrays. Seriously the data is nested pretty deep. At the top level the shape array each index is an array of each shape at each rotation. This means that `shapes[1]` would give be the array of all rotations for shape 1, `shapes[1][0]` would be the two dimensional array representing shape 1's first rotation.

```js
...

export default function NextBlock(props) {
	const nextShape = useSelector((state) => state.game.nextShape)
	const box = shapes[nextShape][0] // Get the first rotation
  ...
}
```

_Now you can use data mapped to props_. The `shape` key on props now holds the index of the shape to display.

# Product So Far

Refresh the browser to see a different shape/orientation appear in the Next Block area! Our Next Block now **uses Redux/Flux to manage application state!** We also covered working with **systems that manage and merge complex arrays,** and have gotten some more practice with **using functional programming methods like `map`!**
