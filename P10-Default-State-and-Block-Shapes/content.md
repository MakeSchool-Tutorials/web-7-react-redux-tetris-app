The game will work by managing it's state in a series of arrays stored in Redux. Manipulating and comparing these arrays will determine what the game shows and how the game plays.

Nested arrays represent a two dimensional data structure. This reflects the two dimensional grid the game is played on.

# Representation via Array

The game board is an 18 x 10 grid:

![Two-Dimension-grid-with-Arrays](assets/Two-Dimension-grid-with-Arrays.png)

Each shape will be stored as a 4 x 4 grid. These arrays are stored as arrays of rows where the value represents a column. The values are either **0 (empty)** or **1 (draw a block)**. For example the "T" shaped block could be visualized like this:

![Shape-Array-T](assets/Shape-Array-T.png)

Shapes can be rotated so there will be a 4 x 4 grid representing each rotation. The array of shapes and their rotations could be visualized like this:

![Shapes-Array](assets/Shapes-Array.png)

To access the array containing the shape data, we'll
use the _index of the shape followed by the index of
the rotation_, e.g.

`shapes[shapeIndex][rotationIndex]`

This would return the 4 x 4 two dimensional array containing the 0s and 1s describing one of the shapes e.g. `shapes[2][0]` would give the "T" shape in the above diagram.

# Game State

Game state is an object stored in Redux. This object will have all of the properties that manage the game. Here is a list of all properties with a short description.

- **grid** : (Array) nested array describing the game board
- **shape** : (Int) **index** of current shape block controlled by player
- **rotation** : (Int) rotation **index** of the current shape block
- **x** : (Int) horizontal position of the current shape block on the game board
- **y** : (Int) vertical position of the current shape block
- **nextShape** : (Int) **index** of the next shape to play
- **isRunning** : (Bool) true when game is running, false when paused
- **score** : (Int) number of points scored
- **speed** : (Int) speed of falling blocks
- **gameOver** : (Bool) true when game is over

# Game Board

The game board will be defined as a set of nested Arrays representing rows and columns. There will be 18 rows of 10 columns.

Each grid square will be represented by an integer:

- 0 is an empty square
- 1-7 represent a color.

All of the color values have a corresponding CSS class name in the stylesheet.

An example game board array might look like this:

```JavaScript
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0],
 ... 14 more rows ...
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
]
```

The grid above shows the game board with a "T" shaped block in color 3  near the top.

# Empty Array

You need a function that will generate a default
empty array. This function needs to return an array containing 18 arrays, each of the nested arrays should contain ten 0s. This represents an empty game board.

> [action]

> Write a function in `/src/utils/index.js`. Try filling in this function on your own, and then check the solution when you're done:
>
```JavaScript
...
// Returns the default grid
export const gridDefault = () => {
  const rows = 18
  const cols = 10
  const array = []
>
  // Fill array with 18 arrays each containing
  // 10 zeros (0)
>
  return array
}
```

<!-- -->

> [solution]
>
```js
for (let row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
    array.push([])
    for (let col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
      array[row].push(0)
    }
}
```

# Shapes

Shapes will be mapped onto the board. There are There are 7 shapes. Let's represent them here as letters. The letters approximate the outline of the shape:

- I (has two rotations)
- T (has four rotations)
- L (has four rotations)
- J (has four rotations)
- Z (has two rotations)
- S (has two rotations)
- O (has one rotation)


Some requirements for the shapes:

- Each shape will be mapped to a two dimensional array with a 1 where the shape should draw and 0 every else.
- Each shape can be rotated and it's rotations will be grouped together into an array.
- All of the rotation arrays will be grouped into a master shape array.
- There will be an extra empty shape at the 0 index.
- The color of each shape corresponds to it's _index_ in the top level of the shape Array.
    - For example, given the order above, the "T" shape is color 2, and the I shape is color 1.

]
```

# Generate Random Shapes

The game needs to generate a random shape from the
shape array. Add a function to handle this.

> [action]
>
> Add the following to `/src/utils/index.js`:
>
```JavaScript
// Return the index of a random shape from 1 to the number of items in `shapes`
// We don't want the first item, which is an empty shape
export const randomShape = () => {
  return random(1, shapes.length - 1)
}
```

The game will use the returned index to get the shape.

# Game State

We need a function that will return the default object that redux uses with all of the properties reflecting a default game state.

> [action]
>
> Write a function in `/src/utils/index.js` that generates the default state of the game.
>
```JavaScript
// Return the default state for the game
export const defaultState = () => {
  return {
    // Create an empty grid
    grid: gridDefault(),
    // Get a new random shape
    shape: randomShape(),
    // set rotation of the shape to 0
    rotation: 0,
    // set the 'x' position of the shape to 5 and y to -4, which puts the shape in the center of the grid, above the top
    x: 5,
    y: -4,
    // set the index of the next shape to a new random shape
    nextShape: randomShape(),
    // Tell the game that it's currently running
    isRunning: true,
    // Set the score to 0
    score: 0,
    // Set the default speed
    speed: 1000,
    // Game isn't over yet
    gameOver: false
  }
}
```

We now have a default state for our game, and we **used Redux/Flux to manage the application state!** We also covered the beginnings of **building systems that manage and merge complex arrays!**
